# eodiro

eodiro is a web service that helps university students to find empty classrooms and see timetable easily with beautifully designed UI and carefully designed UX.

## How to Use

eodiro is designed to be used without any guide by extremely limiting the number of user actions. All you have to do is just visit the website https://eodiro.com and enjoy the app.
