# eodiro

eodiro is a web service that helps university students to find empty classrooms and see timetable easily with beautifully designed UI and carefully designed UX.


## How to Use

eodiro is designed to be used without any guide by extremely limiting the number of user actions. All you have to do is just visit the website https://www.eodiro.com and enjoy the app.


## Build Instructions

Although the eodiro is a well-made ready-to-use service, we provide a guidance for developers who want to build the software on their own and test it themselves.

0. You must install Node.js and NPM before following the steps below.

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Go to the project's root directory and install npm packages.

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Build server and client source codes.

```bash
$ npm run build-all

# or you can build the server and the client separately
$ npm run build-s build
```

4. Run server

```bash
$ npm start
```


## Contributing

Basically we don't approve any kind of contributions that are directly related to the source codes. However, we're welcoming the timetable data contribution. Contact support@eodiro.com if you want to contribute other universities' timetable which are not supported by eodiro yet.
